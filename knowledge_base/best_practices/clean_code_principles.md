# Clean Code Principles

Clean code is code that is easy to understand, easy to change, and easy to maintain. It's about writing code that is clear, concise, and effective.

## Key Principles:

*   **Meaningful Names:** Use descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, and files. Avoid abbreviations and single-letter names unless contextually clear.
*   **Functions Should Do One Thing:** Functions should be small and do one single, well-defined task. This improves reusability and testability.
*   **No Side Effects:** Functions should not modify data outside their scope unless explicitly designed to do so (e.g., setters).
*   **Comments:** Use comments to explain *why* something is done, not *what* is done. Code should be self-documenting.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling. Don't return null; throw exceptions or use optionals.
*   **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code. Abstract common logic into reusable functions or classes.
*   **Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS):** Favor simplicity over complexity. The simplest solution that works is usually the best.
*   **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Don't add functionality until it's actually needed. Avoid over-engineering.

Adhering to these principles leads to more robust, maintainable, and understandable software.
