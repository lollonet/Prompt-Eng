# Component-based Architecture

Component-based architecture is a design approach that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled, interchangeable, and reusable components. Each component encapsulates its own logic, UI, and state.

## Key Principles:

*   **Reusability:** Components can be reused across different parts of an application or even in different projects.
*   **Modularity:** Applications are broken down into smaller, manageable, and independent units.
*   **Encapsulation:** Each component manages its own internal state and behavior, exposing a well-defined interface.
*   **Loose Coupling:** Components interact through defined interfaces, reducing dependencies and making the system easier to maintain and scale.
*   **Testability:** Independent components are easier to test in isolation.

This architecture promotes faster development, easier maintenance, and better scalability, especially in front-end development (e.g., React, Vue, Angular).
