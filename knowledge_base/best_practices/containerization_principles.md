# Containerization Principles

Containerization is a lightweight alternative to full virtualization that packages an application and its dependencies into a single unit, enabling it to run consistently across different environments.

## Core Principles:

*   **Isolation:** Containers provide process and resource isolation, preventing conflicts between applications.
*   **Portability:** A containerized application runs the same way regardless of the underlying infrastructure.
*   **Consistency:** Ensures that the application behaves identically from development to production.
*   **Efficiency:** Containers share the host OS kernel, making them more lightweight and faster to start than virtual machines.
*   **Immutability:** Container images are immutable; changes are made by creating new images, promoting consistency and easier rollbacks.
*   **Single Responsibility:** Ideally, each container should run a single process or concern.
*   **Statelessness:** Applications within containers should be designed to be stateless, with persistent data stored externally (e.g., in volumes or databases).

Understanding these principles is crucial for designing and deploying effective containerized solutions.
