# Docker Best Practices

Adhering to Docker best practices helps create efficient, secure, and maintainable Docker images and containers.

## Key Practices:

*   **Use Official Images:** Start with official base images when possible.
*   **Minimize Image Size:**
    *   Use multi-stage builds.
    *   Remove unnecessary files and dependencies.
    *   Choose smaller base images (e.g., Alpine).
*   **Leverage Build Cache:** Order instructions in your Dockerfile from least to most frequently changing.
*   **Use `.dockerignore`:** Exclude unnecessary files and directories from the build context.
*   **Run as Non-Root User:** Avoid running processes inside the container as the root user for security.
*   **Define CMD and ENTRYPOINT:** Clearly define the default command and entry point for your container.
*   **Expose Only Necessary Ports:** Limit exposed ports to what is absolutely required.
*   **Volume Management:** Understand and use volumes for persistent data.
*   **Tag Images Properly:** Use meaningful tags (e.g., version numbers, commit SHAs).

Following these practices leads to more robust and secure containerized applications.
