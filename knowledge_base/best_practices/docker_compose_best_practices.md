# Docker Compose Best Practices

Best practices for using Docker Compose to define and run multi-container Docker applications.

## Key Practices:

*   **Version Control:** Keep your `docker-compose.yml` file under version control.
*   **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables for sensitive data or configuration that changes between environments.
*   **Service Naming:** Use clear and descriptive names for your services.
*   **Health Checks:** Define health checks for services to ensure they are ready before dependent services start.
*   **Volume Mapping:** Explicitly define volumes for persistent data.
*   **Network Configuration:** Define custom networks for better isolation and communication between services.
*   **Resource Limits:** Set CPU and memory limits for services to prevent resource exhaustion.
*   **Build Context:** Ensure your build context is minimal to speed up image builds.
*   **Separate Development and Production:** Use multiple Compose files (e.g., `docker-compose.yml` for development, `docker-compose.prod.yml` for production overrides).

Following these practices improves the reliability, maintainability, and scalability of your multi-container applications.
