# ESLint Recommended Configuration

ESLint is a static analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code. The `eslint:recommended` configuration enables a core set of rules that report common problems in the code.

## Key Aspects:

*   **Error Detection:** Catches common syntax errors, undeclared variables, unused variables, and other potential runtime issues.
*   **Code Quality:** Enforces best practices that lead to more robust and maintainable code.
*   **Consistency:** Helps maintain a consistent coding style across a project.

## Benefits:

*   Early detection of bugs.
*   Improved code readability and maintainability.
*   Reduced cognitive load for developers.

## Usage Notes:

*   Often extended with other configurations (e.g., `airbnb`, `plugin:react/recommended`).
*   Can be configured via `.eslintrc.js`, `.eslintrc.json`, etc.
*   Integrates with most IDEs and build systems.

Using `eslint:recommended` is a strong baseline for any JavaScript project.
