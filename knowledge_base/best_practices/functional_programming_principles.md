# Functional Programming Principles

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. It emphasizes immutability, pure functions, and higher-order functions.

## Key Principles:

*   **Pure Functions:** Functions that, given the same inputs, will always return the same output and have no side effects (they don't modify external state).
*   **Immutability:** Data structures are not modified after creation. Instead, new data structures are created with the desired changes.
*   **First-Class Functions:** Functions can be treated as values: passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables.
*   **Higher-Order Functions:** Functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as results (e.g., `map`, `filter`, `reduce`).
*   **Referential Transparency:** An expression can be replaced with its value without changing the program's behavior.
*   **Declarative Style:** Focus on *what* to do rather than *how* to do it.

Functional programming can lead to more concise, predictable, and testable code, especially in concurrent and parallel environments.
