# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Principles

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the management of infrastructure (networks, virtual machines, load balancers, etc.) in a descriptive model, using the same versioning as DevOps team uses for source code.

## Core Principles:

*   **Version Control:** Infrastructure definitions are stored in version control (e.g., Git).
*   **Idempotency:** Applying the same configuration multiple times yields the same result.
*   **Automation:** Infrastructure provisioning and management are automated.
*   **Testing:** Infrastructure code is tested like application code.
*   **Modularity:** Break down infrastructure into reusable components.
*   **Documentation:** The code itself serves as documentation.
*   **Collaboration:** Teams collaborate on infrastructure changes using standard development workflows.
*   **Immutability:** Prefer immutable infrastructure where changes are made by replacing components rather than modifying them in place.

IaC brings the benefits of software development practices to infrastructure management, leading to faster, more reliable, and scalable deployments.
