# Multi-container Application Design

Designing applications composed of multiple containers involves considerations for communication, data persistence, and orchestration.

## Design Principles:

*   **Single Responsibility Principle (for containers):** Each container should ideally do one thing and do it well.
*   **Loose Coupling:** Containers should be loosely coupled, communicating via well-defined APIs (e.g., HTTP, message queues).
*   **Service Discovery:** Implement mechanisms for containers to find and communicate with each other dynamically.
*   **Data Persistence:** Externalize persistent data using volumes or external storage solutions.
*   **Networking:** Design clear network topologies for inter-container communication.
*   **Logging and Monitoring:** Centralize logs and metrics for all containers.
*   **Orchestration:** Use tools like Docker Compose (for local dev) or Kubernetes (for production) to manage the lifecycle of multi-container applications.
*   **Scalability:** Design services to be horizontally scalable.

Effective multi-container design leads to resilient, scalable, and maintainable distributed systems.
