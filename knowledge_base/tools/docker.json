        "Consistent environments across development, testing, and production",
        "Application isolation and portability",
        "Faster deployment and scaling",
        "Resource efficiency"
    ],
    "usage_notes": [
        "Requires a Dockerfile to define the container image.",
        "Images are built from Dockerfiles and stored in registries (e.g., Docker Hub).",
