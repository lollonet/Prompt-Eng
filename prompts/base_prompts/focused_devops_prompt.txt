version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@db:5432/myapp
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile example
FROM node:16-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

FROM node:16-alpine
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs && adduser -S nextjs -u 1001
WORKDIR /app

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## REQUIREMENTS
{{ code_requirements }}

## IMPLEMENTATION STEPS
1. **Create Dockerfile** with multi-stage build and security best practices
2. **Setup docker-compose.yml** with service dependencies and health checks
3. **Configure environment variables** for different deployment stages
4. **Add Ansible playbooks** for automated deployment
5. **Include monitoring setup** (health checks, logging)
6. **Write deployment scripts** with rollback capabilities

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- ✅ Containers build without errors
- ✅ Services start up and pass health checks
- ✅ Environment variables properly configured
- ✅ Ansible playbook deploys successfully
- ✅ Monitoring shows service status

## QUALITY CHECKLIST
After implementation, verify:
- [ ] Docker images follow security best practices (non-root user)
- [ ] All services have proper health checks configured
- [ ] Environment variables don't contain secrets in plain text
- [ ] Ansible playbooks are idempotent (can run multiple times)
- [ ] Deployment includes proper backup and rollback procedures
- [ ] Monitoring covers all critical service metrics

Please implement step by step, explaining your choices for container orchestration and deployment strategy.
