- Proper separation of secrets from code/configuration
- Rotation and lifecycle management of secrets

**Evidence Required:**
- Specific examples of secret handling in the prompt
- Assessment of secret exposure risks
- Evaluation of secret management best practices

### 2. PRIVILEGE ESCALATION PREVENTION (Weight: 20%)
**Evaluation Focus:**
- Non-root user execution principles
- Least privilege access patterns
- Proper service account configuration
- Sudo usage restrictions and justification

**Evidence Required:**
- User context and privilege settings
- Service execution permissions
- Administrative access patterns

### 3. NETWORK SECURITY (Weight: 15%)
**Evaluation Focus:**
- Network segmentation and isolation
- Firewall rules and port exposure
- TLS/SSL encryption implementation
- Secure communication protocols

**Evidence Required:**
- Network configuration security
- Communication encryption status
- Port exposure assessment

### 4. ACCESS CONTROLS (Weight: 15%)
**Evaluation Focus:**
- Authentication mechanisms
- Authorization frameworks
- Multi-factor authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

**Evidence Required:**
- Access control implementation
- Authentication method security
- Authorization granularity

### 5. ENCRYPTION USAGE (Weight: 15%)
**Evaluation Focus:**
- Data-at-rest encryption
- Data-in-transit encryption
- Encryption algorithm strength
- Key management practices

**Evidence Required:**
- Encryption implementation details
- Algorithm and key strength assessment
- Encryption coverage completeness

### 6. VULNERABILITY MITIGATION (Weight: 10%)
**Evaluation Focus:**
- Known vulnerability addressing
- Security patch management
- Dependency security scanning
- Runtime security monitoring

**Evidence Required:**
- Vulnerability assessment coverage
- Patch management strategy
- Security monitoring implementation

## SECURITY SCORING METHODOLOGY

### Scoring Scale:
- **0.9-1.0**: Exceptional security - Exceeds enterprise standards, implements defense-in-depth
- **0.8-0.89**: Strong security - Meets enterprise standards with comprehensive controls
- **0.7-0.79**: Good security - Adequate protection with minor gaps
- **0.6-0.69**: Conditional security - Significant improvements required before production
- **0.0-0.59**: Inadequate security - Major security risks, not suitable for production

### Risk Assessment:
- **CRITICAL**: Immediate security threats that could lead to system compromise
- **HIGH**: Significant security gaps that pose substantial risk
- **MEDIUM**: Moderate security concerns requiring attention
- **LOW**: Minor security improvements recommended

## COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK ALIGNMENT
Evaluate against relevant standards:
- SOC 2 Type II security requirements
- PCI DSS for payment processing
- HIPAA for healthcare data
- GDPR for personal data protection
- SOX for financial controls
- ISO 27001 security management

## THREAT MODEL CONSIDERATIONS
Assess protection against:
- **External Attacks**: Unauthorized access, data breaches, DDoS
- **Internal Threats**: Privilege abuse, data exfiltration, insider attacks
- **Supply Chain**: Dependency vulnerabilities, third-party risks
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud misconfigurations, container escape, network attacks

## SECURITY EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Threat-First Analysis**: Start by identifying potential attack vectors and threats
2. **Control Assessment**: Evaluate the effectiveness of implemented security controls
3. **Risk Quantification**: Assess the likelihood and impact of identified risks
4. **Compliance Mapping**: Map security controls to relevant compliance requirements
5. **Evidence-Based Scoring**: Provide specific evidence for each security criterion
